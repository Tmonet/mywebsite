         <h2>Using The Concepts to Create: recommended materials(if done by hand) and instruction on how to use the concepts above.</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>Crescent Rendr No Show Thru Paper. It is the best for ink and markers. If you do not have access to this paper I recommend using any of the Strathmore inking papers.</li>
           <li>Obviously a pencil, preferably not mechanical because the line work will come out sloppy.</li>
           <li>A Prismacolor inking pen in .3 , .5 and a B or C pen(or anything similar to the Prismacolor brand).</li>
           <li>Should have an eraser.</li>
           <li>Copic markers. Layer the colors from lightest to darkest to avoid messy marker tips.  The best brands are Prismacolor and Blick Art Materials copic. These markers blend really nicely.</li>
           <li>White gel pen. This is optional, but it gives your art a nice finish.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Step by Step. This is a cartoon, so NOTHING is perfect. I am not a professional, and I am still learning.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3620.jpg" alt="(materials used)" class="rotate"></figure>

        <p>First, draw out the SHAPE you want your character to have. I chose SQUARE with round edges so my character comes off as playful. Heads up, I am drawing my dog.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3608.jpg" alt="(Using Shape)" class="rotate"></figure>

        <p>Next, sketch out the facial/body/clothing features. He is a Boston, so that would explain his design.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3609.jpg" alt="(This part just depends on your character.)" class="rotate"></figure>

        <p>After you are HAPPY with your sketch, ink it. This is where the Prismacolor pens would come in handy. I mainly used .3 , but use the one you feel fits best.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3610.jpg" alt="(Let your ink dry for a few mins before you start the next step.)" class="rotate"></figure>

        <p>Now for the fun part: coloring. I used the Copic brand. The markers are listed above in ORDER of use. I used a blue color scheme because as said before, blue means loyalty. My dog is very loyal, so, I thought the color fit. I used the lightest blue first, even though it is hard to see. Light colors first.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3612.jpg" alt="(Sorry for the bad lighting.)"></figure>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3615.jpg" alt="(This is a closeup so you can try to see the light blue.)"></figure>

        <p>I almost always go back in with a white gel pen. Donâ€™t forget to sign your name.</p>
        <figure><img src="IMG_3618.jpg" alt="(The white gel pen could rub off, so give it some dry time before touching it.)" class="rotate"></figure>
