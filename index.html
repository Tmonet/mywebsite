      <h2>About Me and an Introduction to Creating Characters by Hand</h2>
      <p>I have been drawing since I was a little girl. I would draw animals all the time! As I got older, I became more interested in drawing people and cartoon characters. As most people start out, I began with manga. I never read any. I just liked
        to draw it. After that, I gravitated towards different types of cartoon styles. I would imitate the cartoons that were on at my house. I fell in love with the process of creating a new character. If you are interested in seeing more of my
        art, my instagram is Taylor Monet (fry_tay). On the next page, you will learn how shapes contribute to character design.</p>
