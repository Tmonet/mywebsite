    <h2>About Me and an Introduction to Creating Characters by Hand</h2>
    <p>I have been drawing since I was a little girl. I would draw animals all the time! As I got older, I became more intrested in drawing people and cartoon characters. As most people start out, I began with manga. I never read any. I just liked to draw it. After that, I gravitated towards different types of cartoon styles. I would imitate the cartoons that were on at my house. I fell in love with the process of crreating a new character. If you are interested in seeing more of my art, my instagram is Taylot Monet (fry_tay). </p>
